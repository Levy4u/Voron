Voron 2.4 Mandala Rose Works Kinematic Bed Lock

Currently only designed for 350mm variant.

This mod is to be used if you have the Mandala Rose Works Kinematic Bed system. The magnets are great for easy removal for larger servicing but for something like a quick fan debug it's slightly too much effort to unplug (even with the bed wago mod).

So I created this to hold the bed on each side for easy tipping of the Voron for service.

Tip: You can losen the bolt and swivel to the locks to the side. They are low profile enough to stay out of the way.
