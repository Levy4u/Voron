## Voron 2.4 Mandala Rose Works Kinematic Bed Mount Lock

Currently only designed for 350mm variant.

This mod is to be used if you have the Mandala Rose Works Kinematic Bed system. The magnets are great for easy removal for larger servicing but for something like a quick fan debug it's slightly too much effort to unplug (even with the bed wago mod).

So I created this to hold the bed on each side for easy tipping of the Voron for service.


I've included the fusion 360 file. Feel free to modify/improve.

#### BOM
